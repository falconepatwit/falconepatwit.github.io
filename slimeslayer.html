                            <p style="text-align: left;">This game currently has 5 different zones, each with a separate enemy 
                                type: Grassy Plains, Fluorescent Fields, Cerulean Clearing, 
                                The Final Forest, and King Slime's Castle. The game contains one class currently 
                                (the knight), although I am currently working on the mage and archer classes. 
                                The game has a boss for the level, the King Slime, which has two different 
                                attack types that challenge the player to use the mechanics in creative ways 
                                to defeat him. There is a questing system, in which each area contains its 
                                unique quest in order to receive gold and experience. Each area also includes 
                                a shop to spend the gold received through completing quests or defeating enemies. 
                                The project has a Spawn Manager that, after a cooldown, will spawn the correct enemies 
                                in a random area inside their specific zone (up until the spawn cap for that area). 
                                There is a saving and loading system, which creates files on the player's computer 
                                storing the variables required in the playthrough, such as location, current health, 
                                attack, maximum health, and many more. This data is converted to binary using a Binary 
                                Formatter, to ensure that the player cannot change their saved data to get an advantage. 
                                The save method specifically creates a file stream which will in turn create and serialize 
                                the save data inside of the player's computer, a directory that is decided by the "persistentDataPath" 
                                command. When running the load function, it checks if there is a file inside of that specific path, and 
                                if so it will open that data using a new file stream, deserializing and returning the data found. This game 
                                also included an array of sound effects, consisting of two different background music tracks, two player 
                                attacking sound effects, enemy idle and hurt sound effects, block sound effects, and much more. These sounds 
                                were able to be adjusted using the options menu, which incorporated a volume slider so that the player could 
                                easily adjust the sound without leaving the game.</p>
