                            <p style="text-align: left;">This platformer game was created in the Unity Engine, and consisted of a core gameplay loop where the player 
								would try to maneuver their way through difficult terrain by using complex movement. It contained a spawn manager to instatiate the fireballs at a 
								fixed interval and Rigidbodies along with box colliders to detect collision. If these fireballs 
								collide with the player, then they will 
								lose a heart and respawn at their farthest progressed checkpoint, if they lose all three, then they will reach the 
								game over screen, and restart the game from the beginning. The player must reach the end of the stage, where they will collect
								a key, triggering an event which will increase the difficulty of the stage.
								 The fireballs will fall much more frequently and faster, making it significantly harder for the player as 
								 they have to travel back towards the beginning of the stage and use the key to open the chest.
								 If the player is able to bring the key to the chest and open it, they successfully complete the level. The game 
								 also included a sound system, complete with jump, hurt, victory, and game over sound effects, paired together with background 
								 music. </p>
