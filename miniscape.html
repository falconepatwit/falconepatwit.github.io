                            <p style="text-align: left;">Miniscape was developed using the Unity Engine during a week-long game jam. The game features a player character who navigates around a square planet, with the end goal of collecting the Gem of Purification and 
								bringing it to a Purification Chamber. The main mechanic of Miniscape that seperates it from other platformers is the dynamic gravity: when a player moves to a different side of the planet, gravity shifts to pull them toward the center of 
								that particular planet. For example, if a player starts on the north side of the planet and moves to the west face of the planet, west will now become "up" for the player, which is demonstrated in the gif above. 
								Miniscape also contains a wall-jump mechanic, indicated by the yellow paint in the game (displayed in the above gif section). The main difficulty for players is the corruption that is "taking over" the worlds, which is visually
								signified with different colors depending on the level. Although primarily represented in the ground or walls of the planet, corruption can take the form of 
								trees, gems and more. If the player interacts with the corruption, then they will recieve a "Game Over" and must restart that specific level from the beginning. 
								There are three different levels available, and they all feature a different theme: Altered Forest, White Canopy, and Corrupted Cosmos. 
								While the player will complete the level when they bring the Gem of Purification to the Purification Chamber, they can recieve 
								an alternative win screen for that level if they defeat all the enemies present (enemies can be defeated by jumping on their head).
