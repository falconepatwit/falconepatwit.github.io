                            <p style="text-align: left;"> This project was developed to become more familiar with creating custom game engines. 
                                This project uses C++ and Raylib to create a custom-made engine that was used to develop Lite Souls. Lite Souls includes 4 different levels, with three levels 
                                consisting of stages with Enemy NPCs located throughout, and an additional level type being a "town" that can be used 
                                to talk to friendly NPCs and receive upgrades after defeating certain bosses. The enemies in these three levels contain unique AI depending on 
                                what type of enemy they are: the pathfinding enemy type uses raycasting to determine the location of the player, and if the player is within the enemy's detection range, 
                                the enemy will path towards the player as long as it can see them (not blocked by terrain). The sentry enemy stands in place and summons projectiles to shoot in a certain direction, which can damage the player. 
								All enemy projectiles in Lite Souls are destructible, and the player can destroy these projectiles by attacking with either weapon. Lite Souls incorporates 3 different 
								bosses in the levels, each with unique mechanics, and an advanced iteration of the sentry AI. The bosses contain a patrolling system that will 
								path towards several points in a direction that is determined when creating the level, while also summoning projectiles towards the player. Lite Souls contains a save and load system that allows the player to continue on a previous attempt 
								with the same progression as they had previously.
